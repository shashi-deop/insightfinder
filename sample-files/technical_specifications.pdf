TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS DOCUMENT
Version 2.1 - March 2024

System Architecture Overview
This document outlines the technical specifications for our cloud-based platform, including system requirements, API specifications, and deployment guidelines.

Core System Requirements
- Operating System: Linux (Ubuntu 20.04+)
- CPU: Minimum 4 cores, 8GB RAM
- Storage: 100GB SSD (minimum)
- Network: 1Gbps connection
- Database: PostgreSQL 13+

API Endpoints
1. Authentication Service
   - POST /auth/login
   - POST /auth/register
   - POST /auth/refresh
   - POST /auth/logout

2. User Management
   - GET /users/profile
   - PUT /users/profile
   - GET /users/{id}
   - DELETE /users/{id}

3. File Operations
   - POST /files/upload
   - GET /files/{id}
   - PUT /files/{id}
   - DELETE /files/{id}

4. Search API
   - POST /search/semantic
   - GET /search/history
   - POST /search/advanced

Database Schema
Users Table:
- id (UUID, Primary Key)
- email (VARCHAR, Unique)
- password_hash (VARCHAR)
- created_at (TIMESTAMP)
- updated_at (TIMESTAMP)

Files Table:
- id (UUID, Primary Key)
- user_id (UUID, Foreign Key)
- filename (VARCHAR)
- file_path (VARCHAR)
- file_size (BIGINT)
- mime_type (VARCHAR)
- created_at (TIMESTAMP)

Search_Results Table:
- id (UUID, Primary Key)
- query (TEXT)
- file_id (UUID, Foreign Key)
- similarity_score (FLOAT)
- created_at (TIMESTAMP)

Security Specifications
- Authentication: JWT tokens with 1-hour expiry
- Password hashing: bcrypt with salt rounds 12
- API rate limiting: 100 requests per minute per IP
- CORS: Configured for localhost:3000
- Data encryption: AES-256 for sensitive data

Performance Requirements
- API response time: < 200ms for 95% of requests
- Search latency: < 500ms for semantic search
- File upload: Support up to 100MB files
- Concurrent users: 1000+ simultaneous connections
- Uptime: 99.9% availability

Deployment Guidelines
1. Environment Setup
   - Use Docker containers for consistency
   - Implement CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
   - Set up monitoring with Prometheus/Grafana

2. Database Migration
   - Use Alembic for schema migrations
   - Backup strategy: Daily automated backups
   - Replication: Master-slave setup for read scaling

3. Security Checklist
   - SSL/TLS certificates installed
   - Firewall rules configured
   - Regular security audits scheduled
   - Vulnerability scanning enabled

Testing Strategy
- Unit tests: 90% code coverage minimum
- Integration tests: All API endpoints covered
- Load testing: 10x expected traffic
- Security testing: OWASP Top 10 compliance

Monitoring & Logging
- Application logs: Structured JSON format
- Error tracking: Sentry integration
- Performance monitoring: APM with New Relic
- Health checks: /health endpoint

Future Enhancements
- GraphQL API implementation
- Real-time search with WebSockets
- Machine learning model improvements
- Multi-language support
- Mobile app development

Documentation
